# Fantasy Football Draft Order Release 2021 
This year we will each be randomly assigned 2 Olympic men's climbers, and their performances will decide the draft order.

## Rules For Draft Oder
The draft order will be decided by best placement of either assigned climber.
The better the placement the lower the draft order pick. 
#### Tie Breaker
In the event that there is a tie, the following will be utilized for the tie breaking rules.
1) Placement of the second climber
2) Best placement in any of the 3 events by either climber  
  2b) Second best placement in any of the 3 events by either climber  
  2c-2f) Third-sixth best placement in any of the 3 events by either climber  
3) Top ranking by either climber in bouldering

*Thanks to Nathan for thinking of the rules and tie breakers.*

The Olympic Scoring
> The Olympic finals will consist of six men, whittled down from a field of 20 men qualification round (there are no semi-finals). The final standings at the end of the event will be determined by a multiplied score of athletes’ placements in all three disciplines—with the lowest score earning the gold medal.
